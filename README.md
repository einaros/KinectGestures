Basic Kinect API demo app, featuring upper body interpolation, some basic gestures and sound effects on trigger.

The sound effect mp3's referenced have been removed, to save Github's harddrives and my lawyer expenses. There are various effects availble at http://soundfxnow.com -- give that a go.

To run the application, given an actual Kinect sensor and a valid Kinect API install (available from Microsoft Research), you should build it -- then copy the dlls from the Kinect API install folder to the output folder.
